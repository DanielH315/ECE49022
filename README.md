# ECE49022

This is my GitHub repository created for the purpose of showcasing my coding progress to fulfill the PCB layout requirement - Software Design Review.

My program will consist of the ESP32 triggering IFTTT (specifically the IFTTT applet) and compelling the applet to send the user an SMS or mobile notification when a fire is detected. There will be progress done every week and published changes to show what I have been working on. 

My specific subsystem is the Alert Subsystem. When our drone detects a fire source, the ESP32 will process everything and begin to trigger the IFTTT applet. The applet will have webhooks and a service action of either mobile notification or SMS. 

Please contact me if there are any questions/concerns.

# ECE49022

This is a Github repository created for the purpose of showcasing my coding progress to fulfill the PCB layout requirement - software component.

My program is the ESP32 triggering IFTTT (specifically the IFTTT applet) and compelling the applet to send the user an SMS or mobile notification when a fire is detected.

Please contact me if there are any questions/concerns.
